# WP3-Streams (WaterPlan 3)
This is a an old project for including +3000 km streams targeted by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) to the Danish National Water Resources Model (DK-model). The state of the code is chaotic, but a working example for the island of Fyn is included. The objective of the code is to process shapefile linestrings representing streams, but that are lacking proper stream delineation and flow direction, and correcting those two attributes. 

Personal repsository for processing line shapefiles with incorrect direction and delineation of Danish streams.
